Long Short Term Memory unit (LSTM) was typically created to overcome the limitations of a Recurrent neural network (RNN). The Typical long data sets of Time series can actually be a time-consuming process which could typically slow down the training time of RNN architecture. We could restrict the data volume but this a loss of information. And in any time-series data sets, there is a need to know the previous trends and the seasonality of data of the overall data set to make the right predictions.
